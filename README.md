# Mitochondrial_Phylo_Tyto
Building a mitochondrial phylogeny for Tyto species:

In this repository you will find information regarding the data available and a pipeline (in progress) for running a Maximun Likelihood (RAxmL) tree for several species of Tyto owls.

### How to access the iMAC remotely
Working with genomic data usually requires demanding computing resources and each command can take hours or even days. Also genomic data is usually stored in large files, thus the best way to analyse your data is using High performance computing - HPC (aka a cluster: is a collection of many separate servers (computers)). Usually institutions like your university will have or have access a HPC cluster. Now, to be able to analyse your genomic data in a cluster you need to access it remotely from your own computer. For this we need to comunicate with the cluster via a terminal program and the “[shell]” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)).
